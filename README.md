Using the dataset of 210k news article headlines from HuffPost, an LSTM text classifier has been built and news headlines have been categorized based on title and short description. The file path used for the dataset is no longer accessible to me. Therefore, the file path must be reset after downloading the dataset on your own. The link for the dataset is given below.

Also I have managed to save the model inference on a testing dataset that is no longer available to me. Please feel free to split the dataset given above into training and testing
